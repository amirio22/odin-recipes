<h1>Homemade Smash Burger</h1>

<p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.<br>
    Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold.<br>
    I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen.<br>
    These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!<br></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as neede</li>
    <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
    <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
    <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate</li>
    <li>Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<ul>
    <li>pread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned</li>
    <li>Set aside</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each</li>
    <li>Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly</li>
    <li>Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment</li>
    <li>nd immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff,<br>
        sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down</li>
    <li> You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<ul>
    <li> You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt</li>
    <li>Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese</li>
    <li>Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds</li>
    <li>stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks</li>
    <li>Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
</ul>
